# dotjs2019

Hello! Thanks for taking an interest in unit testing native web components!!

This repo serves as a set of examples around testing native Web Components with different testing frameworks.

I've included examples that use different build systems as well in an attempt to cover as many common use cases as I can.

The folders are named with the testing framework and build tooling, and are hopefully self explanatory.

## Slides

[The slides](dotjs2019.pdf) from the presentation are also here in case you want to review them!
