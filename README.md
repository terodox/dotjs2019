# dotjs2019

## Slides

This repository was created as a part of a lightning talk at dotJs Paris.

[The slides](dotjs2019.pdf) from the presentation are available in case you want to review them!

## How to use this repo

This repo is filled with example projects that use different testing frameworks and build systems. I tried to hit the more popular options for both testing and building.

If I missed your framework or build system, please open a PR! I welcome additional contributions!

### Commands to get a project running

Start by navigating into a sub-folder:

```bash
cd jest-webpack
```

Then run the following commands:

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

This will start a webserver at http://localhost:3000 that will show an example usage of the web component in action.

If you want to run the tests, simply run:

```bash
npm test
```

If you run into any trouble, feel free to open an issue, and I'll do my best to help!
